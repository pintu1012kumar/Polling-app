# TODO: Implement Role-Based Redirects and Access Control

## Tasks
- [x] Modify login page to fetch user role and redirect based on role (user -> /polls, admin -> /admin/polls)
- [x] Add role-based access control to /polls page (only allow "user" role)
- [x] Add role-based access control to /admin/polls page (only allow "admin" role)
- [x] Test the implementation with different user roles (User should test by logging in with user/admin roles and verifying redirects and access restrictions)
